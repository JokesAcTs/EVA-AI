## 🧠 What is EVA?

EVA is not just a chatbot—it's a next-gen embodied virtual assistant that:
- Maintains **persistent memory** across sessions  
- Understands and **learns** from multimodal inputs (text, audio, video, code, etc.)  
- Executes code, simulates environments, and acts as a **collaborative AI co-pilot**  
- Adapts and evolves over time through active and reinforcement learning

---

## 🚀 Vision

To build a self-improving, AI-native operating layer that understands humans, systems, and the world—designed for:
- Engineers
- Creators
- Knowledge workers
- Future operating systems
